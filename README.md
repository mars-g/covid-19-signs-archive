Very simple example of how a server could display local image metadata

## Setup
Install python3
Use pip to install
* flask
* Pillow
* reverse_geocoder

## Seeing example
Run `python3 app.py` and navigate to `localhost:5000/image/<name of jpeg w/o file extension>`
The included example is `localhost:5000/image/_1`

## Next steps
This includes just the basic displaying of image data. Next steps would be
1) Create navigateable list of images.
2) Add ability to upload images and have them saved on server
3) Add ability to search by location for images
4) Minor cleanup, adding of new links, etc.
